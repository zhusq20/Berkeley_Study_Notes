# Opensourced-Study-Notes-Berkeley

Those are note archives as well as very well-structured final review docs I made for my self. I put it here so that you can study it and also I will be able to review it later. So if you found this useful, make sure you star my [repo](https://github.com/zhusq20/Berkeley_Study_Notes)
This repository is brought to you by [Siqi Zhu](hhttps://github.com/zhusq20).
